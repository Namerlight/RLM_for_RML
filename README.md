# RLM_for_RML (name tbd, okay)

Robust Language Modelling for Truthful QA

## To-Do

* [ ] Set up dataset (truthfulQA) and preprocess it if needed
* [ ] Set up testing pipeline in run_test.py
* [ ] implement function to extract embeddings from an LM
* [ ] then implement function to get the difference between truthful and false embeddings
* [ ] then add the difference to the LM at inference time
* [ ] coming soon
